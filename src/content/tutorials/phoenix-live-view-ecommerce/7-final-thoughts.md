This was a really fun project. 

This was my first attempt at a long-form tutorial and it was a lot harder than I thought!
I first had the idea for this tutorial in April 2020 and I wrote some play-around code. 
Then I got really serious and drafted the first page in December 2022.

I would build a bit of it then take a break. Pick it back up and have to re-build it using newer live-view patterns.

Elxir is probably my favorite programming language. Phoenix is a fantastic framework. Tailwind was a real joy to work with, as always. Stripe is world-class. 
I went into this only knowing surface level details of Live-View, and now I feel like I can build anything with Live-View.

I would 100% use this stack for other projects.

_Finished application on [github](https://github.com/tylerwray/amazin)._
