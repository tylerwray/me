## Introduction

I've heard alot of buzz over the last ~3 years about [Phoenix LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view),
so I wanted to actually build something to test it out! At it's core, Phoenix LiveView is a framework for writing real-time web applications using a programming langauage loved by many; [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/).

## What to expect

We're going to build an ecommerce application powered by [Stripe](https://stripe.com) and Phoenix LiveView. Along the way learning
about Phoenix LiveView, some basics of Stripe, and tailwindcss.

The stack we will use in this tutorial —

- Elixir
- Phoenix Framework
- Postgres
- Tailwindcss
- Stripe

At the end of this tutorial you will have accomplished —

- Building a Phoenix Live View application.
- Style that application with TailwindCSS.
- Take payments in your application with Stripe.

This is going to be fun, let's dive in.

TL;DR - _Finished application on [github](https://github.com/tylerwray/amazin)._
