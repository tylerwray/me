# Concept

Astro is amazing. Simple from the start and extensible when needed. Gastby was becoming slow and a burden. I don't need GraphQL for static content.

# Objective

Show how much I love my blog setup. Give someone the courage to build something simple with Astro. Showcase the simplicity and performance of Astro.

# Material

Markdown with frontmatter is awesome. I didn't need MDX. MDX in astro is actually slow.
Astro islands are awesome (explain post overview component).
Astro has official plugins for everything I needed, Gatsby lacked official plugins

# Plan

Explain my hook into astro (theo on youtube, arthur at podium, islands architecture).
Explain my issues with Gatsby (slow in browser and builds and dev, react only, lack of offical extensions, too much GraphQL, no strong Typescript support).
Talk about making the switch (using astro components, typescript, porting posts and images).
What I've loved so far (speed, focus on static content, JSX is nice)

# Organization
