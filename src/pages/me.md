# Hello, I'm Tyler Wray. üëã

For as long as I can remember, I've loved everything technology.

I was born in Pocatello, Idaho; but I grew up in Provo, Utah.
Living in Provo until the age of 10, I spent lots of time dreaming of
being a BYU football player. Most of my summers were spent in Idaho on my
grandparent's farms, or on trips to lake powell, moab, Oregon, and other
fun places. I had the perfect childhood, and have been extremely blessed
my entire life.

Currently, I am a student at UVU in the Computer Science department; I am
married to my highschool sweetheart, Ashley; and I have two young girls,
Lyla and Cecily. I work full time as a Software Engineer for
[Podium](http://podium.com). Some of my favorite past-times
are; Playing Golf, Making delicious Espresso, Playing Basketball, enjoying my two children, being with family, and
doing yard work! I'm a [#dad](https://twitter.com/wray_tw/status/1127774420724895744?s=20)
through and through.
